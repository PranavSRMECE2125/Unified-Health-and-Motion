 Project Description: Unified Health and Motion Monitoring Wearable for Senior Citizens
This project involves the development of a compact, real-time wearable device tailored for senior citizens, aiming to provide continuous health and motion monitoring. The device integrates two primary sensors — the MAX30102 for health data and the MPU6050 for motion sensing — and features an embedded machine learning algorithm for intelligent fall detection.

The MAX30102 sensor captures critical health parameters such as heart rate (HR), SpO₂ (oxygen saturation), and body temperature. Simultaneously, the MPU6050 collects 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data to monitor movement and detect irregular motion patterns. The onboard fall detection algorithm, powered by machine learning, analyzes this motion data in real-time to accurately detect falls, reducing the risk of undetected injuries in elderly individuals.

This wearable is designed with low-power operation in mind and can be integrated with wireless communication modules for remote health monitoring, making it suitable for home-based elderly care, assisted living environments, or hospitals. The solution prioritizes user safety, mobility, and independence, while offering caregivers actionable insights into the user's health and activity.
